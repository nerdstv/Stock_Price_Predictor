# Stock_Price_Predictor
Due to interest in the stock market and data science, I developed a predictive model capable of forecasting future stock prices for a specific stock.
• Implemented data preprocessing steps, including data import, selection of relevant features, and normalization using MinMaxScaler
• Used an RNN model with four LSTM layers and Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer
and Mean Squared Error loss function.
• Predicted stock prices using a trained model and demonstrated its performance by comparing the predicted and actual prices on a graph
